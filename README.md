# Milestone Project 1 (DRAFT-1)

In this project i have created a static one page website for a band. I have used a mobile first approach ensuring that the website looks good on all screen sizes. The wesite is broken down into 5 section with navigation between sections.

The HTML and CSS files have been validated and there are no errors.
 
## UX
 
The first thing i done in the UX process was to research the band and gather as much information as possible, I spoke to the lead singer who is a family member and also looked at their current website. 

After my research i went through some the following user stories:

- As a potential fan, I want to find out information about the band, so that I can see what genre music they play.
- As a potential fan, I want to listen some music the band plays, to see if i would like it.
- As a fan, I want to find out where/when the band are playing, so that I can see what gigs i can go to.
- As a fan, I want to be able to book tickets to gigs, so that i dont have to search other sites for tickets.
- As a fan, I want to keep up to informed about new releases, so that i can buy their new music.
- As a potential booker, I want to listen to the band, to find out if they are what i want for my function.
- As a potential booker, I want to see the band in action, to see how they perform.
- As a potential booker, I want to see contact the band, to find out if they are available.

I then created 3 different wireframes,  a 5 page website and 2x 1 page websites which can be found in the assets folder hosted here [Wireframes]( assets/wireframes). after evaluating the pros and cons i decided to go with the one page website [version 1.3]( assets/wireframes/1.3) as this would best suit the functions required. I then developed the website, initialy inputing the basic structure and all the information for the final site then woking my way to the design phase with HTMl5 and CSS3 using the mobile first approach ensuring that the website functioned correctly on the smallest screen first then worked my way up to the largest screen.

This website was built mainly for fans of the band to keep up to date with the band but can also be used by potential fans and promoters to book the band for gigs. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp)
    - The project uses **HTML5**.

- [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
    - The project uses **CSS3**.     
    
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to simplify responsive design process.



## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
